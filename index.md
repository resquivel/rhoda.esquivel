Rhoda is a software engineer, entrepreneur, and best-selling book co-author. Her mission is to make team life better, more fun, and happier. 

She is the founder and CEO of [Woolfie](https://www.woolfie.team), a startup looking to bring fun back into remote work. She is also currently a software engineer at Cash App, and she's been working in and around Agile teams for the past 7 years.

In the past 3 years, she has previously worked as an engineer in an Agile, distributed team spanning 2 countries -- in-office, hybrid, and fully-remote. These experiences have given her various insights into better ways of navigating this increasingly remote world.

In her spare time, she jumps from hobby to hobby. At the moment, she likes crocheting and watching the UFC, but not at the same time!
